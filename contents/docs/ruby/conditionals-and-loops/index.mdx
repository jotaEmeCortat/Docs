## Conditionals

✅ ruby everything is _truthy_ except `false` and `nil`.

### if / elsif / else

```ruby
hour = Time.now.hour

if hour < 12
  # executed when condition is truthy
  puts "Good morning!"
elsif hour > 12
  # executed when condition is truthy
  puts "Good afternoon!"
elsif hour >= 20
  # executed when condition is truthy
  puts "Good night!"
else
  # executed when condition is not truthy
  puts "Lunch time!"
end
```

⚠️ The order of the conditions may matter!

### if !

```ruby
if !condition
  # code executed only when condition is not "truthy"
end
```

### unless

```ruby
unless condition
  # code executed only when condition is not "truthy"
end
```

### Ternary operator

```ruby
puts "heads or tails?"
choice = gets.chomp
coin = ["heads", "tails"].sample

result = (choice == coin) ? "winner" : "loser"
puts "#{result}, that was #{coin}"
```

### case / when / else

```ruby
puts "What do you want to do?"
action = gets.chomp

case action
when "read"
  puts "You are in READ mode"
when "write"
  puts "You are in WRITE mode"
when "exit"
  puts "Bye Bye"
else
  puts "Wrong action"
end
```

### Inline conditions

For short single-line statements or methods that return a boolean value.

```ruby
# do_something if condition
# do_something unless condition

number = gets.chomp.to_i
puts "your number #{number} is even!" if number.even?

# or

def allowed_to_vote?(age)
  age >= 18
end
```

### Multiple conditions - AND

`&&` is the logical AND

```ruby
true  && true             #=> true
false && false            #=> false
true  && false            #=> false
false && true             #=> false
true  && false && true    #=> ?
```

### Multiple conditions - OR

`||` is the logical OR

```ruby
true  || true            #=> true
false || false           #=> false
true  || false           #=> true
false || true            #=> true
true  || false || true   #=> ?
```

Exemple:

```ruby
hour = Time.now.hour

if (hour > 9 && hour < 12) || (hour > 14 && hour < 18)
  puts "The shop is opened!"
else
  puts "Sorry, the shop is closed..."
end
```

## Loops
### for

Used for iterating over a collection of elements.

```ruby
for num in [1, 2, 3]
  puts num
end
```

### until

Used when a condition is false and you don't know how many times you will loop.

```ruby
price_to_find = rand(1..5)
choice = nil     # variable initialization

until choice == price_to_find
  # executed until condition is truthy
  puts "How much (between $1 and $5)?"
  choice = gets.chomp.to_i
end

puts "You won! Price was #{price_to_find}$"
```

### while

Used when a condition is truthy and you don't know how many times you will loop.

```ruby
price_to_find = rand(1..5)
choice = nil     # variable initialization

while choice != price_to_find
  # executed while condition is truthy
  puts "You won! Price was #{price_to_find}$"

  puts "How much (between $1 and $5)?"
  choice = gets.chomp.to_i
end
```
