### Starting

From existing repository (on GitHub for instance)

```bash
git clone <github_ssh_clone_url>
```

from scratch

```bash
mkdir new_project
cd new_project
git init
```

### Status

git can tell you if your folder has some modified files (dirty)

```bash
git status
```

### Add & Remove

```bash
git add <file_1_which_has_been_modified>
#or
git add .

git rm <file_1_which_has_been_removed>
```

### Commit

A `commit` (a snapshot of the folder) is a 3-steps job.

```bash
# You can review your staging area
git status

# Take a snapshot of what is in the staging area.
git commit --message "A meaningful message about this change"
```

### Diff

If `git status` tells you something changed, you can inspect exactly what changed:

```bash
git diff
git diff <a_specific_file_or_folder>
```

### Log

Show commit history with:

```bash
git log

# More fancy command in your ~/.gitconfig
git lg
```

### Branch

Create a new branch

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

Delete a branch

```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

Push a branch to the remote

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

### Merge

Merge a branch into the current branch

```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```


## Remote

### Fork and clone

Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone it locally.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:$GITHUB_USERNAME/git-101-boilerplate.git
git status # it's already tracked by git
```

### Pushing the changes

Once youâ€™ve committed your work, push it to GitHub.

```bash
# Generic command
git push <remote> <branch>

# What we'll use
git push origin master
```
